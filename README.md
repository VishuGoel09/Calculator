# Calculator App

A Modern UI Based Calculator Built Using Flutter Which Can Do Simple Arithmetic Calculations.I've created a calculator app with the following features:
1. Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
2. Clear button (C) to reset calculations
3. Backspace button (âŒ«) to correct input mistakes
4. Decimal point support
5. Error handling for division by zero
6. Clean, responsive UI with proper spacing and styling using Tailwind CSS
The calculator follows these UI/UX principles:
* Clear visual hierarchy with a large display
* Properly spaced buttons for easy interaction
* Color-coded buttons (blue for operators, red for clear, green for equals)
* Responsive layout that works on different screen sizes.

Setup Instructions
1. Open the project in Android Studio.
2. Connect an Emulator or a Physical Device (with USB Debugging enabled).
3. Click Run to build and launch the app.
